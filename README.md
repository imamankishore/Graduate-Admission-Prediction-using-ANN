# 🎓 Graduate Admission Prediction using ANN

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the chances of a student's admission to a graduate program based on their academic profile. The model uses input features like GRE Score, TOEFL Score, CGPA, SOP, LOR, University Rating, and Research experience.

## 📌 Key Features
- Built using **Python, Keras, and TensorFlow**
- Preprocessing includes feature scaling and data cleaning
- Model trained and evaluated for accuracy using R² score
- No overfitting observed — stable performance on training & test data
- Achieved an **R² score of 0.80**

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- GRE Score
- TOEFL Score
- University Rating
- SOP (Statement of Purpose)
- LOR (Letter of Recommendation)
- CGPA
- Research (0 or 1)
- Chance of Admit (Target)
